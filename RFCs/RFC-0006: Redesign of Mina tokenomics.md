## Abstract

Mina’s tokenomics, especially the high inflation brought by supercharged rewards, has been the concern of many community members, as evident by the number of posts on the [MIP channel of Mina Research](https://forums.minaprotocol.com/c/mips-mina-improvement-proposals/24). The upcoming hardfork is set to introduce zkApps (smart contracts), layer 2s, and many other exciting but complicated features to Mina, which also makes the original tokenomics design - a linear emission model - outdated. In this RFC idea, instead of proposing a tokenomics model directly, we outline the importance, opportunity and difficulty to design a successful model for Mina, and propose that Mina Foundation commission a thorough review and redesign of Mina’s tokenomics post hardfork, taking in account the critical aspects as outlined here.
