# Launch-Grants Program 🚀

Welcome to the Launch Grants Program by Mina Foundation! The project's mission is to empower and support innovation within the Mina ecosystem.

## How It Works
Embark on a journey of contribution and innovation with these simple steps:

1. 🍴 **Fork and Propose:** Start by forking this repository. In the [RFCs](./RFCs/) directory, create a new markdown document using our [RFC template](./RFCs/rfc-0001-template.md) to share your innovative ideas.
2. 💬 **Pull Request for Feedback:** Commit your RFC document to your fork and open a pull request here. This is where your ideas get discussed and refined with community inputs.
3. 🎨 **From RFC to RFP:** Once an RFC is finalized, it evolves into an RFP (Request for Proposal) stage where we issue grants for fulfilling the RFC objectives.
4. 🔄 **Creation and Delivery:** This cycle continues until there exists tangible results — be it software, designs, or other forms of output.

## Types of Grant Tracks
Your innovative solutions could receive grants from Mina Foundation, subject to milestone achievements.
- 🌐 **Ecosystem Advancement:** Here, we focus on proposals originating from RFCs, covering specific scopes and deliverables.
- 🌍 **Public Goods:** Aimed at supporting new developments, maintenance, or enhancement of Mina Protocol.
